<!-- Explanation of what the app is -->

This is a very cool Music Player app written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS that allows the user to sift through a couple songs, start, pause and change the song to the previous or next song in the array/playlist. This was my first foray into using audio files in an app and I found it very interesting.

Screencastify unfortunately did not record the audio for this app, but I encourage the viewer to click the link to the deployed app to check it out for themselves.
